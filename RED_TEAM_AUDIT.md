# Red Team Security Audit: Claude Skills Ecosystem

**Date**: 2025-12-28
**Status**: ✅ Remediated
**Auditor**: Antigravity (Simulated)

## Executive Summary

This audit identified critical security gaps in the Claude Skills ecosystem, focusing on mobile development and API security. All identified vulnerabilities have been remediated.

---

## 🛡️ Vulnerability Findings & Remediation

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials (P0) - ✅ FIXED

* **Finding**: Previous templates allowed or implied hardcoding of API keys.
* **Remediation**: `mcp-builder.md` and mobile skills now strictly prohibit hardcoding and mandate Environment Variables or Secure Storage.

### 2. Insecure Data Storage (P0) - ✅ FIXED

* **Finding**: iOS `UserDefaults` and Android `SharedPreferences` (plaintext) were commonly used for tokens.
* **Remediation**:
  * **iOS**: `ios-development.md` now implements `KeychainService` with `SecAccessControl`.
  * **Android**: `android-development.md` mandates `EncryptedSharedPreferences`.
  * **Flutter/RN**: secure storage libraries are now standard.

### 3. Cleartext Network Traffic (P1) - ✅ FIXED

* **Finding**: No enforcement of HTTPS.
* **Remediation**:
  * `rest-api-design.md` enforces TLS 1.3.
  * `android-development.md` includes `network_security_config.xml` to block cleartext.

### 4. SQL Injection Risk (P0) - ✅ FIXED

* **Finding**: Potential for SQL string concatenation.
* **Remediation**: `database-ops.md` now includes a P0 warning against string concatenation and enforces parameterized queries.

### 5. Sensitive Data Leaks (P1) - ✅ FIXED

* **Finding**: Logging of sensitive data (PII, tokens) in console.
* **Remediation**: All "Forbidden" sections now explicitly ban logging sensitive data in production.

## 📋 Audit Conclusion

The `claude-skills` ecosystem has been hardened significantly. Best practices for security are now integrated directly into the skill templates, ensuring that future code generated by Claude using these skills will be secure by default.

**Verdict**: **PASSED**
